The command line Control Centre contains a nested set of graphical menus
that you can easily navigate to find useful command line programs.

The purpose is twofold: to make it easy to get to these commands quickly and to
demonstrate what commands are available and what they do.

.Navigation:

Use the arrow keys and Home and End to move up and down in a menu.  Enter
selects the highlighted item, either a submenu or a program to run.

.Command File:

A list of all the commands you execute is stored in the file
antiX-cli-cc.cmd in your current working directory.  This is a handy way
to learn how to use the commands without the Control Centre.
