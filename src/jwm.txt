.What is this?

The desktop is run by JWM, a lightweight window manager for the X11 Window System. 
JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum.

.Where are the icons?

JWM does not use icons, but antiX has an application that can manage 
desktop icons for it ie ROX.

ROX comes already preconfigured with some icons in antiX, open it in 
Menu --> Desktop --> Other Desktops

.What's that stuff in the upper right corner?

That is the output of Conky, a light-weight system monitor that gives you 
real-time information on various aspects of your computer.

.And that bar at the bottom?

That is called the toolbar or panel, and it displays current info such as 
the workspace, open applications, background applications and the date/time.
