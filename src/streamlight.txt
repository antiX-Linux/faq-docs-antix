== What is Streamlight
{top}

Its main purpose is to provide you with an easy way to play or download antiX help videos from Youtube. It can do this without using a modern, heavyweight, web browser that might place high demands on your system which is sometimes seen as degraded performance.

Streamlight can be used in partnership with almost any web browser, even those that cannot natively handle videos.  It is also possible to use it without any web browser.  It will work with any application in which your cursor can highlight the address of a video.  For example a word processed document, a PDF file, a plain text email, or a terminal command line.

Because it is so economical in its use of your system resources, Streamlight is equally well suited to both modern powerful kit, and older less capable kit.

Videos can be handled from a range of other popular, anonymous video streaming services, in addition to Youtube.  These should be regarded as a bonus rather than a mainstream goal of Streamlight. The focus is on delivering antiX help videos from Youtube to hardware of greatly differing capabilities.  Features and facilities beyond this objective are deemed to be outside the scope of the project.

== Typical Use Case
{top}

The user prefers to work by clicking buttons rather than by typing commands.  Their interest is in using their system rather than understanding its technicalities. Beyond the applications they normally use day-to-day, they have low levels of confidence in their technical abilities.  Applications that are simple to use and easy to understand are high priorities.

{nbsp}

=== Scenario 1 Play a Live Stream on Old Kit

* The hardware specification and capability of your system is modest by modern standards but it runs antiX OK +
* Using a fully featured, heavyweight web browser noticably limits the ability of your system to run other apps concurrently +
* Streaming a live video in your heavyweight web browser overloads your system and produces degraded performance +
* You want to browse Youtube using a lightweight browser which is better suited to your system +
* You want to select a Youtube video and play its live stream +
* You want to choose the on screen size (resolution) of the video in order to manage the CPU demand on the system +
 
{nbsp}

=== Scenario 2 Download a Stream on Modern Kit

* You have an email containing the address of a Youtube video you want to download and save as a file +
* You do not want to install a web browser plugin to do the download and prefer to not use an online conversion service +
* You want to choose the highest resolution in which the video is available in order to get the best picture quality +
 
{nbsp}

{nbsp}





== Getting Started
{top}

Streamlight may be started in three ways:

* Manually from the main menu in _Icon_ mode (Illustrated in scenario 1) +
* Manually from the main menu in _Run Once_ mode (Illustrated in scenario 2) +
* Automatically launch _Icon_ mode at startup

=== Automatically Launch Icon Mode at Startup

.desktop-session/startup


[icon="./images/icons/tip2.png"]
[TIP]
A simple way to add an item to run at session startup +
1. antiX Control Center->Session Tab->User Desktop Session +
2. When the editor opens->Startup Tab +
3. Type in your item +
4. Save the file and close the editor
