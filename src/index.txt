== Introduction

image:wm/default_desktop.jpg"[]

If you're a first-time user of antiX  â€” welcome!

Instead of a heavy common Desktop Environment, antiX uses window
managers to control what the end-user can see and do. We hope these
FAQs will give you a basic orientation to antiX and its window
managers, and provide the means to explore further on your own.

antiX comes in four flavours for 32 and 64 bit boxes.
antiX comes as a 'full' distro (<800MB), 
a 'base' distro (<700MB), 
a 'core' distro (c310MB) 
and a 'net' distro (c150MB) 
all with a kernel that will boot "antique" PII, PIII computers as well as the latest "modern" processors. 

NOTE: The 'full' flavour will not fit on a cd. The 'base' version fits on a cd, but does not include libroffice.
 
By default, antiX loads into a Rox-IceWM desktop with a few icons on the desktop. 
Use 'F6' at the boot menu screen to choose your desktop. 
What you choose running live will automatically transfer if/when installed.

antiX is a very flexible linux distribution. You can run it live from a
cd, live from a usb stick (with persistence ie changes are saved on
reboot) as well as setting up a 'frugal-install' from an internal or
external hard drive. Of course, you can install to internal and
external drives, sticks, cards etc. You can even run it live,
add/remove applications, customize it, remaster it and then install. 
All your changes will carry over to install!

antiX is based on 'Debian' but is totally free of 'systemd'! It comes with 
a custom kernel, its own custom scripts and repository to enhance user
experience. antiX can be used as a 'rolling release' distro ie you should be able
to keep your applications up to date by regularly upgrading. If you
wish you can enable the Debian testing or unstable repositories and live on the
'bleeding-edge'! For those that prefer stability, keep to the Debian
Stable/stretch repositories.

A further feature of antiX is that you can install kernels from a
variety of sources including Debian, siduction, aptosid and liquorix. 
This is especially useful if you have a new box as newer hardware is more
likely to be detected and work with newer kernels. 

Don't forget - antiX is systemd free!

== System requirements.
{top}

=== So what are the minimum and suggested requirements to run antiX?

antiX should run on most computers, ranging from 192MB old PII systems with 
pre-configured 128MB swap to the latest powerful boxes. 

'antiX-core' and 'antiX-net' will run with '128MB RAM plus swap', but don't expect miracles!

'192MB RAM' is the 'recommended minimum' for antiX. 
'256MB RAM' and above is 'preferred' especially for 'antiX-full'.

'antiX-full' needs a '3.8GB' minimum hard disk size. 
'antiX-base' needs '2.6GB' and 
'antiX-core' needs '1.0GB.'
'antiX-net' needs '0.7GB.'

== Pre-Installation.
{top}

=== Which flavour should I use?

Most users will be happy to use 'antiX-full' as it offers a full desktop experience
on legacy and modern computers.

If you have a very old desktop/laptop with less than 256MB RAM (PII, PIII), or you want 
a desktop with "the basics", it is probably best to use 'antiX-base'.

If you want complete control over what applications to install and know the Debian
system fairly well, then use 'antiX-core' or 'antiX-net' since both these do not include X.

NOTE: 'antiX-core' is no longer using a libre kernel and includes non-free firmware,
which means that most wireless is supported.


=== Why are there so many 'F' options in the boot menu?

Choice! antiX tries to make it easy to boot on any hardware ranging from old boxes where 
booting with xvesa is needed to boxes with nvidia, radeon and intel drivers.


=== I don't want icons on the desktop, how do I disable them?

Use 'F6' to set the desktop and do not choose any of the 'Rox-' or 'Space-' options.


=== Can I install applications when running 'live'?

Yes you can and if you decide to install during that 'live' session, they will carry over to installation.

== Installation
{top}

=== I have an old laptop with very low RAM, what should I do?

If you have less than 128MB RAM, and want to test antiX live, choose one of the 'min-' options at 'F6'.
To install to hard drive, at the live boot menu, type 3, login as root and type cli-installer.

It is also a good idea to create a swap partition before installation.


=== Where should I install grub?

If users are happy with their present bootloader, grub-legacy, grub2 or whatever else, then 
it is best to install grub to the root partition or don't install it at all and then make
the necessary changes after installation.

If you are installing only antiX over another OS, or dual booting with windows, then install 
grub to the MBR.


=== Will the language, keyboard settings I chose at boot menu carry over to install?

Yes, in fact this is the best way to install your 'localised' antiX.

Set your options via the 'F2' and 'F3' keys and if you use a writable device, use 'F8' to save your choices.

Alernatively, you can do this manually by setting a variety of 'cheats'. For example: 'lang=en'  
'kbd=gb,gr'  'tz=Europe/Athens' will give a US English desktop, a toggled Greek, British English keyboard 
and the timezone set to Athens, Greece.

== Post Installation.
{top}

=== How to Setup nvidia graphics drivers? 

antiX suggests using the gui app found in the control centre or 'smxi' tools. See smxi section.


=== How to autologin?

The installer gives you the option to set auto-login.
Control Centre-->Session-->Set auto-login
You will need to reboot for changes to take effect.


=== How to set the correct date and time?

The best way is to do so at first boot when running live. 'F4' has these options.

* hwclock=ask

* hwclock=utc

* hwclock=local

Default is set to UTC.

You are also given an option during installation to set the hwclock.

If you missed the above, then there are 3 possible issues:

1) wrong timezone

2) wrong selection of UTC versus local time

3) BIOS clock set wrong 

The first issue is addressed with 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata'. Do this first. You should also be able 
to just check the current value with 'cat /etc/timezone'.

Once you are sure the timezone is correct, you can work on setting your BIOS clock. Do this with the 
'hwclock' command. First do a 'man hwclock' and then run 'hwclock --show' to see what it is set to. It 
always reports in localtime which is why you need to first make sure your timezone is set correctly.

Use 'hwclock --localtime' or 'hwclock --utc' depending on whether you want your hardware clock to be 
set to localtime or utc. Most pure Linux systems use utc. Most dual boot systems use localtime.

Then, after you get your date command working via the sudo command you posted, you can use 
'hwclock --systohc' to set the hardware clock so it matches your system time. Again, you need the 
timezone and localtime/utc choice set correctly first (although if you want to *assume* they are set 
correctly already then this is the only command you need to run to get your changes to the 'date' 
command to stick. If you assumed incorrectly then you will likely get mysteriously screwed by DST 
a few times per year).

Finally, if you are having problems with hwclock drift or if you are a perfectionist then you can 
install the 'ntp' package which will use time servers on the net to keep your clock exactly on time. 
But you have to first go through the steps above before 'ntp' will work correctly.


=== How to edit sources list? 
     
Either via synaptic (for 'antiX-full') Control Centre--> System--> Manage Packages--> Settings--> Repositories 
or edit individual files in /etc/apt/sources.d/ (for 'antiX-base' and 'antiX-core')


=== How to enable the Firewall?

'Gufw' is installed, but not enabled.
Open Control Centre--> Network--> Manage Firewall


=== How do I find which applications to install?

Both 'antiX-full' and 'antiX-base' come with 'package-installer', which makes it easy to install
popular applications. See below for more information.

'antiX-full' and 'antiX-base' also come with 'synaptic' so searching for applications is easy.

To search for applications in 'antiX-net' and 'antiX-core' use our new tool 'cli-aptiX' or use 'apt-cache search' in a terminal

For example:  'apt-cache search video player'


=== How do I keep the system up-to-date?

antiX is set up using 'Debian Stable' repositories by default. This allows 
users to keep their system up to date with regular upgrades. antiX recommends
using 'apt-get update' followed by 'apt-get dist-upgrade' in a terminal. Alternatively, use smxi. 
Synaptic is also available for those that prefer a gui tool.


=== DVD videos don't play. How come?

You will need to install 'libdvdcss2' and maybe some codecs by enabling the 'deb-multimedia' repository
(see above how to do this) and then either search for 'libdvdcss2' in synaptic and then install or use
the command line.

 * apt-get update
 * apt-get install libdvdcss2

The easiest way is to use the 'package-installer' application as it automatically does the above for you.

antiX strongly advises users not to keep the deb-multimedia repository enabled as there may be
conflicts.


=== What window managers are available in antiX?

These window manager options come installed and ready to use in antiX-full and antiX-base:

* the lightweight Rox-IceWM (default) 
* the lightweight IceWM 
* the lightweight SpaceFM-IceWM 
* the minimalist manager Rox-Fluxbox
* the minimalist manager Fluxbox
* the minimalist manager SpaceFM-Fluxbox
* the very minimalist manager Rox-JWM
* the very minimalist manager JWM.
* the very minimalist manager SpaceFM-JWM.

All window managers can be run with or without the ROX or SpaceFM Desktop 
environment that provides drag-and-drop functionality or the Conky 
system monitor that displays real-time information.

antiX also comes with 'herbstluftwm', a manual tiling window manager.


=== What are the 'min-' options?

If you want to keep RAM usage as low as possible, you can choose one of the
'min-' options. There is no wallpaper, no desktop icons, no conky and no applications running in the panel. 


=== How do I change from one WM to another?

You can switch by clicking on the menu --> Desktop --> Other Desktops, 


=== And how to set the default one?

Whichever one you have running before reboot, will be the default.

=== Toggling Conky on/off:

In IceWM:           

Right click on Desktop --> Desktop--> Settings--> Conky on/off

In Fluxbox:        

Right click on Desktop --> Desktop --> Conky on/off

In JWM:        

Right click on Desktop --> Desktop --> Settings--> Conky on/off


=== How do I get out of antiX?

IceWM:  
         
Click on the Desktop-->Logout 
there are several options including shutdown.

Fluxbox:
         
Right Click anywhere on the Desktop --> Exit, which will present you 
with the choice to lock screen, hibernate, reboot, logout, suspend, or shut down.

JWM:  
         
Click on the Desktop-->Logout 
there are several options including shutdown.

Easy. Just press 'F7' console ('F6' on core or net) and choose the 'default' option.


=== What do you mean by Safe Video Mode and Failsafe in the menu?

Safe Video Mode
Disable KMS (kernel mode set) video drivers and force the use of the vesa video driver. 
Try this option of the system seems to boot but the screen is blank.

=== Tell me more about those Desktop Settings

Since antiX is designed to work on older boxes, we have attempted to make the desktop session more robust.
Also, we have tried to make it as easy as possible for new users and highlight its features.
However, depending on your hardware and tastes, you may wish/need to make some changes.
For example, increasing/decreasing the desktop startup delay.
The configuration files are found in Control Centre-->Session-->User Desktop Session


=== Can you give me an example?

Ok, I want to use IceWM without desktop icons, choose a colour background, and only have the volume icon on the taskbar.
My box is new, so I want to reduce the startup delay and keep conky on the desktop.

1.Boot using IceWM option or change to it via Menu-->Desktop-->Other Desktops

2.Control Centre-->Session-->User Desktop Session click on 'startup' tab and comment # entries you do not want to use

3.Control Centre-->Session-->User Desktop Session click on 'desktop-session.conf' and make the following changes
Startup delay "0"
Notification dialog "false"

4.Use the Wallpaper application in Control Centre-->Desktop to set 'No wallpaper' and a background colour.

5.Logout and log back in to your customised desktop. They will be saved on reboot.


=== What kernel is antiX-17 using? 

A customised 4.10.5 version.

There are several other kernels available via the 'package-installer' application. Such as:

* custom-4.13.4 for 64 bit processors
* custom older kernels such as 4.4.10 for 64/32 bit, pae and non-pae.
* various non-PAE and PAE 'libre' kernels for both stable and testing/sid


=== Does flash work?

Yes, OOTB! For some PII/PIII/PIV boxes, you may need to use an older version of flashplugin.
If the default browser firefox-esr crashes, remove flash.
