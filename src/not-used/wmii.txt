== What is wmii?
{top}

wmii is a small, dynamic window manager for X11. 
It is scriptable, has a 9p filesystem interface and supports classic and tiling (acme-like) window management. 
It aims to maintain a small and clean (read hackable and beautiful) codebase.
  
The following tips are intended to help the user get started with wmii. 

== How do you use wmii?
{top}

To make it easier for new users to wmii to get started, antiX comes with a very basic wmii setup.
If you want to start from scratch all on your own, simply delete the ~/.wmii folder.

.How do I start wmii?

If you are running live, simply type 'desktop=wmii' at the boot menu.
If you are booted into IceWM, fluxbox or JWM, logout and toggle F1 to see wmii login entry.

.WTF?

Yes, bare isn't it.
Don't panic, some keybindings have been set up to help. Feel free to change.

When you don't know tiling, it's not really easy to start working with it. 
You have to learn hotkeys to launch programs and move or resize windows. 
By default in antiX, the "Mod" key is the 'Windows' key also known as "Mod4". 
The hotkeys to learn at the beginning are:

    Mod4+Enter -> Terminal (roxterm)

    Mod4+p -> menu : a menu appears, just type the start of the name of an application to open it

    Mod4+d -> default layout : screen space is divided among the windows

    Mod4+s -> stacked layout : the selected window takes up all the screen, you see only the title bar of the others

    Mod4+j -> select the window below

    Mod4+k -> select the window above

    Shift+Mod4+j -> move the window down

    Shift+Mod4+k -> move the window up

    Mod4+a -> Actions menu : choose "quit" to quit 

.Are any applications set up to open?

Yes, the following come with antiX.

    Mod4+n -> iceweasel : Starts the internet browser.
    Mod4+r -> rox : Opens the default rox filer.
    Mod4+e -> sudo rox : sudo rox needs to be set up for this to work. See /etc/sudoers.d/antixers.
    Mod4+x -> xmms : Opens xmms audio player.
    Mod4+l -> leafpad : Opens a basic text editor.
    Mod4+Shift+l -> xlock : Locks the screen.
    Mod4+Shift+x -> reboot : 

.How do I open a new workspace/desktop/view?

Views are based on the same principle of desktops/workspaces in others window managers. 
They are automatically created when you move a window in them. 
Hotkeys also follow the same principle:

    Mod4+Shift+2 : move selected window to the view "2"
    Mod4+2 : go to view "2" 

The same applies for all numbers from 0 to 9.
