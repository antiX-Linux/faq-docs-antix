== What is Persistence?
{top}

Persistence is a hybrid between a LiveCD/USB and a full install.  One
of the beauties of a LiveCD is that it allows you to boot Linux
without touching any hard drives so you can have a "test-drive" without
fear of altering your current system.  Another feature of a LiveCD is
that once it is burned, it is close to impossible for it to get infected
with a virus or a Trojan horse. Every time you boot it, you start off
with a system that is clean and pristine.

Persistence gives you a way of remembering things between boots.  In
order to do so, it needs access to a read-write device, typically
either a hard drive or a USB stick.  If you are only using one
machine that is yours then you can put the persistence file(s)s on one
of your hard drives.

== Four Kinds of Persistence
{top}

The {antix} distribution offers up to four different forms of persistence on
our Live Media (LiveCD/DVD/USB, etc).  Remastering is only available on
writable media such as a LiveUSB  or a LiveHD (frugal install)  _not_ a CD or
DVD.  All four forms can be used together if desired.  They each have
different strengths and weakness which are important to understand in order
choose the right method or methods for your purposes.

=== Home Persistence
{top}

Home persistence is the simplest and safest.  The +homefs+ persistence file
is mounted at ++/home++.  Any changes made to files under +/home+ are (nearly)
instantly stored on +homefs+ filesystem.  It is good if you want to save
settings (such as bookmarks or changes to your desktop) but it doesn't save
changes made to the system (such as installing packages).  Generally, if you
need the root password to do it then it is not saved.  Home persistence is
also ideal if you want to download and save a lot of data.   It is the safest
precisely because you can't save any system changes with it.  Even if your
system gets compromised, it will be very difficult for the bad guys to make
any permanent changes to your system. 

=== Root Persistence
{top}

Root persistence allows you to save changes to the system _in addition_ to
saving personal settings.  It has two significant limitations.  These
limitations are due to the fact that as the system is running the changes are
stored in RAM and will be lost unless they are specifically copied back to the
+rootfs+ file.  If your computer crashes before the changes are copied back
then your changes will be lost.  The other limitation is that the amount of
new information you can store is limited by how much free RAM you have.  

Dynamic root persistence saves file system changes in RAM (just like a normal LiveCD/USB). 
The persist-save program must be run to copy these changes to the rootfs file so 
they can be remembered across reboots. Use persist-config to have the program run 
automatically on shutdown/reboot. 


=== Static Root Persistence
{top}

Static root persistence is another way to use persistence. Static root persistence saves file system
changes directly in the rootfs file. It does not use any RAM so the only size limit 
is the size of the rootfs file. This makes it good for doing an "apt-get upgrade" 
or for installing a bunch of packages. It is usually best to follow up with a Live
remaster to consolidate the file system changes into the compressed squashfs file. 
On many systems, static root persistence can be annoyingly slow. You are free to 
switch between static and dynamic root persistence each time you boot. 

=== Frugal Installation
{top}

If you have access to a hard drive, you may wish to run antiX from it 'live' with or
without persistence. Using persistence is recommended. The main advantage of running
frugally is that it is very fast and saves space since it uses the compressed squashfs
(linuxfs) which is typically 4 times smaller than installed to hard drive.
antiX has made setting up frugal very easy. Just press F5 at the boot menu and choose
the frugal option. See How do I Create Persistence Files? below for further details.

=== Remastering
{top}

We include remastering as a form of persistence for purposes of comparison.
The link:remaster.html[Remastering page] contains implementation details.  If
root persistence is like using a piton while climbing up a cliff, remastering
is more like setting up a camp or bivouac site.  


== How does it Work?
{top}

The information for both root and home persistence is stored in two files
called +rootfs+ and +homefs+.  Unlike previous versions of antiX, there is no longer
an option to use a entire partition for root or home persistence.  The default
location for these files is right next to the squashfs file, on the same
device and in the same directory.  We suggest that you use this default
location whenever possible, but sometimes it is not possible (such as when
booting from a LiveCD or LiveDVD).  For these cases you can specify which
device the persistence files are on.  You can also specify a different
directory.  


==  How do I Create Persistence Files?
{top}

=== Automatically

The +homefs+ and +rootfs+ persistence files can be created when booting at 
the live desktop menu. Press F5, choose the persist option and on boot you 
will be prompted to set it up. You will be first asked where you want to save
the persistent file(s). You just need to decide how large you want 
to make the file(s). The ext4 file system will be used.
Once the +homefs+ and +rootfs+ files have been created, you will be prompted to
make changes to the root and user passwords. This is for security.
The final step will ask you how you want to set the save mode for root 
persistence. Options include: Automatic, Semi_Automatic and Manual Save. 
On reboot/halt any changes will be saved.

Note: If you have your persistence file(s) on a separate device to the one you
boot from, you must specify your persistence device. You can use the following:
* pdev=sda1 ie persist device
* plab=antiX-Persist ie label of the device where persistence files are kept
* puuid=xxxxxxx ie the uuid of the device.


=== Manually by Using the antix2usb gui app
{top}

You can run antiX live from a usb stick.
To install to usb stick you can use our tool antix2usb or UNetbootin.
Both will work, but our tool enables users to also set up persistence prior to running.
If using UNetbootin you will have to set up persistence once running from the stick/device.

Using antix2usb gui.

* Plugin your usb stick.
* If it auto-mounts, unmount it.
* Open antix2usb from antixcc -> disks -antiX2usb
* Select ISO file.
Navigate to where the ISO file is and click Open.

* Install to USB device should automatically detect your usb device
and show how much space is available.

* System partition.
antix2usb allows users to either use the full disk or part of the disk space
by creating a partition.
If you do not want to use persistence, then minimum recommended size for a partition
is shown below.

 - antiX-full:1GB
 - antiX-base:700MB
 - antiX-core:350MB

* You can set the language here or at the boot menu.

Options:

* Format.
This refers to the usb device partition.
ext4 is recommended.

* Bootloader.
This gets installed into the MBR of the usb device.
syslinux is only used with fat32.

* Persistence.
There are four options here.

 - No persistence - just leave as default.
 - home persistence - check home and select size
 - root persistence - check root and select size
 - Both home and root persistence - check both home and root and select sizes.
