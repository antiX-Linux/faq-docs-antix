. How do I run an application at startup?
There are several ways to start an application at the startup of a desktop session.
Below are three ways that are typically used.

== Startup from file
{top}

antiX allows you to specify to startup an application for all desktop sessions. 
This is handled via a startup file (startup) found in the hidden directory (.desktop-session)
which can be found in your user's home directory. (~/.desktop-session/startup)
You can find this via the control center under:
Menu --> Control Center --> Session --> User Desktop-Session

This startup file is handled as a script; Therefor most typically you would want to start your application as:
my-app &
Where my-app is the executable name of your app and the & means start as a background proccess.

This can also be altered to more complex startup routines such as:
sleep 5 && my-app &
Where the app will be started with a five second delay.

Some standard apps that are added to this file later on (Ex: Wicd) are present in the file already but commented out.

== Startup from file (Window Manager)
{top}

This is the same as Startup from File. 
The only difference is that the app will only be started for one window manager, not the rest.
Therefor the naming convention used would show as replacing "desktop-session" with the window manager.
fluxbox:
~/.fluxbox/startup
~/.icewm/startup
~/.jwm/startup
These can also be accessed throught the control center via:
Menu --> Control Center --> Desktop --> Window Manager Settings
An example usage case for this would be to have tint2 panel start in fluxbox but not icewm or jwm.
For this you would edit ~/.fluxbox/startup adding:
tint2 &
or 
sleep 2 && tint2 &
to give the window manager time to start before running the panel.

== Xdg startup
{top}

The third option is to enable xdg autostart.
This seems to be the standard way that Desktop Environments handle startup applications.
It is also most typically the way an application handles enabling / disabling autostart within the app.
Auto start is handled this way via a desktop file in the users home directory under the config/autostart directory.
(~/.config/autostart/my-app.desktop)

However as the preinstalled window managers in antiX do not support xdg autostart this is handled by desktop-session.
To enable this you will need to set the XDG_AUTOSTART= parameter to "true" (XDG_AUTOSTART="true").
This is found in the desktop-session.conf file under the users home directory in the desktop-session directory.
(~/.desktop-session/desktop-session.conf)
You can also find this file under 
Menu --> Control Center --> Session --> User Desktop-Session

Once the XDG_AUTOSTART parameter is set to true logout and log back in to make it function.
Adding / Editing .desktop files enables / disables the application autostart.
