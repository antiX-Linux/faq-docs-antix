The primary purpose of Snapshot is to make it as safe, easy, and
convenient as possible for users to make a live bootable iso of their own 
installed version of antiX. The idea is that you when you are ready to 
take a snapshot for whatever reason, just use use the iso-snapshot application
and once it is finished, you will have an iso file ready for booting.

Menu-->Applications-->System Tools-->iso-snapshot
