== What is Droopy?
{top}

It is a simple way of using a network connection to make a folder
in your local antiX system available to other systems.  The remote
system can upload and/or download files to and from the folder.

Additional apps are not required on the remote system.  If it has
a web (internet) browser it can access your folder.  Files can be
transferred to and from a PC, laptop, smart phone etc.

The remote system can be Linux, Mac, Windows etc.

== Getting Started
{top}

As long as you have a folder named Public in your home folder, and have
x-terminal-emulator installed, Droopy will work without changing any
settings.

[icon="./images/icons/tip2.png"]
[TIP]
To check whether x-terminal-emulator is installed: +
1. Open a terminal +
2. Type which x-terminal-emulator +
3. If it is installed it will report the name of the terminal app

If it is not installed, or you want to use an alternative, refer to the
section named Fine Tuning,

{nbsp}

{nbsp}




== Starting Droopy
{top}

From the antiX menu select +
image:droopy/droopy.png[]^Droopy^

{nbsp}

A window opens to indicate the Public folder is being served.

image:droopy/droopy-server-window.png[]

The main body of the window is used to monitor which system is accessing
the served folder and what that system is doing.

The titlebar shows the location of the served folder, the local system 
name, and the IP address plus port number Droopy is using. The latter 
parts are used to contact Droopy from a remote system.

{nbsp}

While the window is open Droopy continues to serve the Public folder.
To stop serving it, simply close the window.

{nbsp}

{nbsp}




== Transferring Files
{top}

Put some files in the Public folder to make them available to download.

{nbsp}

=== Transfer Across Local Network

On a different system open a web (internet) browser e.g. Iceweasel. +
In the address area type the IP address and port as shown in the
titlebar of the Droopy server +
For example +
http://192.168.2.129:8800

[icon="./images/icons/tip2.png"]
[TIP]
If a domain name server (DNS) is running on your network a name can 
be used instead. +
For example +
http://antix1:8800

{nbsp}

Iceweasel shows the page served by Droopy

image:droopy/droopy-in-iceweasel.png[]

{nbsp}

*To Upload to the Public Folder* +
1. Press the Browse button +
2. Select one or more files +
3. Press the Send button +

{nbsp}

*To Download from the Public Folder* +
1. Right-click on a file in the list +
2. Select Save Link As +
3. Choose where to save the file

{nbsp}

=== Transfer Across Internet

On the system that is running Droopy, open a web (internet) browser e.g. Iceweasel. +
In the address area type +
http://localhost:8800

{nbsp}

Iceweasel shows the page served by Droopy plus a black banner

image:droopy/droopy-wan-ip.png[]

In the banner, click _Discover the address of this page_. 
This shows the IP address plus port to be entered into the web (internet) 
browser in the remote system which may be anywhere in the world.

{nbsp}

Droopy is likely to be running behind a firewall or a NAT router. 
To enable transfer of files across the internet they must be configured 
to allow connections on port 8800 to your Droopy system.

Because each firewall/NAT router does this in its own way, you should 
refer to its user manual to do the setting up.

{nbsp}

Once the connection has been established, files may be transferred in 
the same way as described above.

{nbsp}

{nbsp}




== Fine Tuning
{top}

You can control the Droopy server by changing its settings.

[icon="./images/icons/info.png"]
[NOTE]
Settings are held in a single hidden file in your home folder +
.config/droopy/droopy.conf

Usually the default settings do not have to be changed for Droopy to work.

{nbsp}

If your system does not have x-terminal-emulator installed you have to tell 
Droopy the name of the terminal emulator to use.  To do this open droopy.conf 
in a text editor.

[icon="./images/icons/tip2.png"]
[TIP]
A simple way to open droopy.conf for editing is +
1. Switch your file manager to show hidden files +
2. Browse to .config/droopy/droopy.conf +
3. Select the file and open it in your text editor

In the file, find the section that sets the terminal emulator.  The default 
setting is for it to be left empty (blank).  Simply enter the name of your 
preferred terminal emulator and save the file.

[icon="./images/icons/settings.png"]
[NOTE]
==== 
Example setting urxvt as the preferred terminal
----
# The name of a preferred terminal emulator in which droopy runs
# Leave empty to use the system default of x-terminal-emulator
# Examples
#  roxterm
#  urxvt
#  xfce4-terminal
# Default, PREFTERM=
PREFTERM=urxvt
----
====

{nbsp}

Each of the other settings has its own section laid out in a similar way. 
Guidance is provided to indicate the purpose of the setting and its 
default value.

{nbsp}

After changing a setting Droopy should be restarted for it to take effect.

{nbsp}
