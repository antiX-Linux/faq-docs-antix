== Synopsis
{top}

This page explains many of the boot parameters that are used by antiX
Live systems.  Most users will get by just fine by making selections
in the bootloader menus.  The boot menus provide a convenient GUI for
setting some of the options documented here.  Use the cheat:F12: key
in the bootloader to see what boot options are selected by your
current menu choices.

== New for antiX-15!

These boot parameters have been recently added.

 * cheat:blacklist=<list>:
   A list of kernel modules to blacklist.  These modules won't get
   automatically loaded.

 * cheat:blacklist=VIDEO:
   If you add cheat:VIDEO: to the list then all KMS video modules will
   get blacklisted.

 * cheat:bootchart:  Create /var/log/bootchart.tgz.  Use the program
   +pybootchartgui to convert this to a .png image to view what happens
   when the Live system boots.  It is designed to stop recording a few
   seconds after conky starts.

 * cheat:desktheme=dark|light:
   Choose either a dark theme or a light theme for the desktop.  Use
   the command +set-desktop-theme+ to change the theme from the
   command line.

 * cheat:earlyvid:
   Try to load KMS video modules earlier in the boot process.  This
   is mainly for debugging but if it works, it may give a a higher
   resolution console slighter earlier in the boot process.

 * cheat:failsafe:
   This has the effect of combining several different boot parameters
   that should allow antiX to boot on most systems and get to
   X-Windows.  Some older system may need to use cheat:acpi=off: and
   so forth.  These options are not enabled by default because they
   may be rarely needed and each one has a cost associated with it
   such as poorer graphics resolution and performance in X-Windows.
   We hope on one will ever need to use the cheat:failsafe: option.
   These are the boot options it enables:

   load=all
   blacklist=VIDEO
   from=all
   xorg=safe

 * cheat:hwclock=local|utc:
   Assume that the hardware clock is set to either UTC or to localtime.
   If you are dual booting with Windows then you should set the hardware
   clock to localtime.  Otherwise, UTC is preferred.

 * cheat:menus:
   Enable a series of text-based menus to make the selections that are
   normally made by the function key popup menus in the Live bootloader.
   This is primarily for booting via UEFI since the UEFI bootloaders
   don't provide support for separate menus.

 * cheat:plink:
   Enable pseudo-links in the AUFS file system.  If you don't know
   what this means then you probably don't want to use it although
   it shouldn't do any harm.

 * cheat:private:
   Get prompted for new root and demo passwords during the boot process.
   The well known and well advertised default passwords for the root and
   demo accounts on the Live system are a security risk.  Using your
   own passwords instead of the defaults should make your system a little
   safer.

 * cheat:savestate: (**LiveUSB Only**)
   Save certain "state" files across reboots even without persistence
   enabled.  Also save certain machine-specific state files across
   reboots.  You can control which files get saved by editing the
   files +/live/boot-dev/antiX/state/general-state-files+ and
   +/live/boot-dev/antiX/state/machine-state-files+.  Those files and
   the directory they are in will be created automatically the first
   time you boot the LiveUSB.  This is enabled by default and it is
   "sticky" so once you enable it it will stay enabled until you turn
   it off.  See below.

 * cheat:nosavestate: (**LiveUSB Only**)
   disable saving state files.  See description above.  This too
   is sticky so when you use it saving state will stay disabled
   until you re-enable it.

== Boot LiveCD/USB
{top}

These options control how the Live media boots.  In particular the
control where we look for the +linuxfs+ file.  The location of this
file will be used for other Live features such as persistence and
remastering.

=== The Boot Device
{top}

The primary job of Live initrd is to find the compressed file system
called a *squashfs* file.  For antiX and MX this file is normally
named +linuxfs+.   We need to find the device this file is on and find
the file on that device.

Normally we scan all cdrom (and dvd) and usb devices for that file.
This default behavior can be modified with the following options.  The
easiest way to specify the boot device is the cheat:from: option which
specifies what type of device to boot from.


 * cheat:from=<list>: The type of boot device.  Valid values:
   cheat:cd hd usb:, and cheat:all:.  More than one is allowed.  The
   default is cheat:usb,cd: so by default we will only look at
   cdrom/dvd devices and usb devices to for the boot directory.  You
   can also specify a device more specifically by giving a device
   name (like +sda1+), a partition label, or a partition UUID.

The cheat:bdev:, cheat:blab:, and cheat:buuid: options allow you
to specify which device we look on to find the +linuxfs+ file.

 * cheat:bdev=<name>: The name of the boot device.  For example
   cheat:bdev=sda:..

 * cheat:blab=<label>: The partition label of the boot device.

 * cheat:buuid=<uuid>: The UUID of the boot device.

**New for antiX-15:** the cheat:buuid: option accepts simple wildcards
such as cheat:*: and cheat:?:.  For example: cheat:buuid:1234*" will
instruct us to look on all partitions that have a UUID that starts
with "1234".

You can combine cheat:from: with cheat:bdev:, cheat:blab:, or
cheat:buuid:.  For example: cheat:from=usb blab=antiX-LiveUSB: will
instruct us to only look for partitions on usb/removable devices that
have the label +antiX-LiveUSB+.  

=== The Boot Directory
{top}

By default, we look for the +linuxfs+ file and and persistence
files in the +antiX+ directory on the boot device.   If you want
to boot more than one Live system on the same device or if you
want to do a frugal install, you should change that directory
and use the cheat:bdir: parameter to point to the new directory.


 * cheat:bdir=<dir>: The boot directory.  This is the directory where
   we look for the +linuxfs+ (squashfs) file, persistence files and
   live-remaster files.  The default is +/antiX+.   The leading slash
   is optional.

 * cheat:sq=<dir/file>: Specify the linuxfs file plus the boot directory
   all at once.  The default is +/antiX/linuxfs+ but the leading slash
   is optional.

=== Debugging
{top}

Sometimes booting problems can be tracked down to a missing driver or
a driver that is not getting loaded.  These two boot parameters can be
helpful in tracking down such problems.

 * cheat:bp=N: Set one or more breakpoints in the live-init script
   separated by commas.  Use cheat:bp=?: to get a list of breakpoints
   to choose from.  The meanings may change with different versions so
   use cheat:bp=?: be sure.

    breakpoint 1  before welcome
    breakpoint 2  before coldplug
    breakpoint 3  before looking for linuxfs file
    breakpoint 4  after mounting boot device
    breakpoint 5  after mounting persistence device
    breakpoint 6  after mounting aufs
    breakpoint 7  before prepare switch_root
    breakpoint 8  before running init.d scripts
    breakpoint 9  right before starting init

    breakpoint F  After fsck
    breakpoint F  Before fsck
    breakpoint e  On possibly fatal error
    breakpoint f  in frugal install
    breakpoint i  after init= chroot
    breakpoint m  before makefs
    breakpoint r  After resize homefs rsync
    breakpoint r  Before resize homefs rsync
    breakpoint tr After copy to ram
    breakpoint u  final umount
    breakpoint v  before check VID
    breakpoint x  before select device

 * cheat:verb=M: Control how much gets printed out during the early
   boot process.  The default level is cheat:verb=5:.  Lower numbers
   print less, higher numbers print more.  Usually cheat:6: or
   cheat:7: will show you more info without being too obnoxious.  The
   full output is available in the +/var/log/live/bootloader.log+
   file.  A partial version of the log file is available at
   +/init.log+ from within most breakpoints.

=== Loading Modules
{top}

One of the primary tasks of the live-initrd is to mount the device
that holds the +linuxfs+ file which contains the final file system.
Modules (also called drivers) sometimes need to be loaded to allow
the kernel to talk to certain types of hardware.  Most of the time
this is taken care of automatically but if you have very old or
unusual hardware, there might be a glitch.


 * cheat:load=<list>: Load one or more specific modules, separated by
   commas. You need to know the name of the module or modules that you
   want loaded for this to be useful.

 * cheat:load=all: Load all modules in the initrd.  This is a shotgun
   approach just in case there is module that is available in the
   initrd that needs to be manually loaded for your system to boot
   that is not getting loaded automatically.  In addition, extra
   debugging information is added to the +initrd.log+ file.

=== Other Booting options
{top}

These options affect the boot process but the don't fit into any of
the categories above.


 * cheat:fromiso=<file>: Use this to boot from a iso file.  This
   feature is deprecated because it defaults some of the more advanced
   features of the Live system but is supported due to popular (or
   otherwise) demand.  This can be abbreviated as cheat:iso=<file>:.

 * cheat:try=NN: The maximum number of seconds to try finding the
   +linuxfs+ file.  The default is 15 seconds.  This replaces
   cheat:rootdelay: which is no longer used.

== Persistence
{top}

These options enable and control Live persistence which allows you to
make changes that will persist across reboots.  These options are
normally used on LiveUSBs but if you specify a persistence device (or
use the default LiveCD persistence device) then you can make use
persistence on a LiveCD.  In this case, the changes will have to be
saved on some other device that allows for read-write access.

**New for antiX-15:** If you enable persistence on a LiveCD and and
device with the label *antiX-Persist* is not found then we will give
you a list of partitions to choose from and offer to give that device
the label *antiX-Persist*.  If a form of persistence is *required* but
the persistence file is not found then we will offer to create it for
you.  We do not offer to create a persistence file if it is merely
*requested* with one exception.  If root persistence is required and
home persistence is requested and neither +rootfs+ nor +homefs+
persistence files exist then we will offer to create both a +rootfs+
file and a +homefs+ file.

 * cheat:persist=<list>: This is the main option for controlling Live
   persistence. It can be given one or more of the following
   parameters, separated by commas:

 - cheat:auto,a: Automatically create +rootfs+ and/or +homefs+ files
   if they don't already exist and they are required.  Normally, we
   will prompt the user for size and file system type.

 - cheat:hd: Only look on internal hard drives for the persistence
   device. This is analogous to cheat:from=hd: for finding the boot
   device.

 - cheat:home!,h!:  Enable and require home persistence.  The exclamation
   point means this form of persistence is required.  A non-fatal
   error will be thrown if it cannot be enabled.

 - cheat:home,h: Request home persistence but don't require it.  We
   will try to enable home persistence but if we can't then this fact
   is briefly noted and the boot continues normally.

 - cheat:root!,r!:  Enable and require root persistence.  The exclamation
   point means this form of persistence is required.  A non-fatal
   error will be thrown if it cannot be enabled.

 - cheat:root,r: Request root persistence but don't require it.  We
   will try to enable root persistence but if we can't then this fact
   is briefly noted and the boot continues normally.

 - cheat:static,s: If root persistence is enabled then use the static
   version of root persistence.  Normally, dynamic root persistence is
   used.

 - cheat:usb: Only look on usb partitions for the persistence device.
   This is analogous to cheat:from=usb: for finding the boot device.

=== The Persistence Device
{top}

Just like the boot device can be specified generally with the
cheat:from=: option and more specifically with options like
cheat:bdev=: the same choices are available for specifying the
persistence device.

On a LiveUSB or a frugal install, the default persistence device is
the boot device which is what you would expect.  Normally the
persistence files will sit alongside the +linuxfs+ file that we are
booting from.

On a LiveCD the default persistence device is whatever device has the
disk label *antiX-Persist*.  If you specify a persistence device with
one of the three options below then the defaults are ignored.

 * cheat:pdev=<dev>: The name of the persistence device.  For example:
   cheat:pdev=sdb2:.

 * cheat:plab=<label>: The partition label of the persistence device.

 * cheat:puuid=<uuid>: The UUID of the persistence device.

=== Other Persistence Options
{top}

 * cheat:ptry=NN: How many seconds to wait for the persistence device
   to appear.  This is only relevant if the peristence device is
   different from the boot device.  The default is 10 seconds.

== Remastering
{top}

These two options affect remastering.  Normally, remastering is done
automatically whenever there is a +linuxfs.new+ file in the same
directory as the +linuxfs+ file.

 * cheat:noremaster: (**LiveUSB Only**) Disable remastering even when
   a +linuxfs.new+ file is found.

 * cheat:rollback: (**LiveUSB Only**) Roll back to the previous version
   of +linuxfs+.   If you remaster and for some reason things go
   horribly wrong, then use this feature to get back to the state
   right before you did the remaster.

== Frugal Install
{top}

**New for antiX-15!**  Automatically do a frugal install from a LiveCD
or LiveUSB to a hard drive or a usb drive.  Persistence files can also
be created automatically so you can literally create and boot into an
installed system in just a minute or two (depending on the speed of
your hardware).

There are two modes of operation that are triggered by the same
cheat:frugal: boot parameter: install mode and boot mode.  Normally
the frugal device is a partition  with the label *antiX-Frugal*
If such a device is not found then you will be given a list of
partitions to choose from.  Once you have selected a device, you
will be given an option to have it give the *antiX-Frugal*
label.  If an antiX frugal install has not already been done on
the device you selected then an frugal install will be performed.

The next time you boot with the frugal option, we will
automatically boot from the *antiX-Frugal* device into the
frugal system that was installed. Again, if a frugal install is
not found on that device, we will automatically install one.

If persistence is requested and the persistence files are not
found then we will offer to create them after we do the install.
If you want to force a persistence file to be created in a later
boot then *require* that form of persistence with an
exclamation point.

 frugal=root     (requested)
 frugal=root!    (required)

 * cheat:frugal: Enable frugal mode.  Either boot into the existing
   frugal system or create a new one if it does not already exist.

 * cheat:frugal=<list>: A contraction of cheat:frugal: and
   cheat:persist=<list>:.  It is common to add persist options when
   enabling frugal mode so you can add the persist options directly to
   the frugal boot parameter.  Example: cheat:frugal=root,home:.

=== The Frugal Device
{top}

Just like you can select the boot device and the persistence device
with device name, label, or uuid, you can do the same with the frugal
device.  If you specify the frugal device this way and it is not found
then we will give you a list of devices to choose from, just like with
the cheat:frugal: parameter, but we will I<not> offer to label the
device you have selected.

 * cheat:fdev: The name of the frugal device.

 * cheat:flab: The partition label of the frugal device.

 * cheat:fuuid: The UUID of the frugal partition.

== X-Windows
{top}

These options affect X-windows.  They will all be carried over when you
do an install.  The various keyboards options are carried over in the
file +/etc/defaults/keyboard+.  The other options are carried over in
the file +/etc/X11/xorg.conf+.

=== Keyboard Options
{top}

A rather complete list of keyboard options and variants is usually
available at +/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst+

 * cheat:kbd=<layout>: Set the keyboard layout.  This is usually one or
   more 2-letter country codes separated by commas.  For example:
   cheat:kbd=gr,us:.  This will allow users to quick switch between
   the US and the Greek keyboard layouts.

 * cheat:kbopt=<options>: Keyboard options.  These give special meaning
   to certain keys or key combinations.  For example
   cheat:kbopt=ctrl:nocaps: turns the Caps Lock key into an extra
   Control key.

 * cheat:kbvar=<variant>: Keyboard variant.  These are variants to the
   keyboard layout. For example cheat:kbvar=dvorak: will give you a
   Dvorak keyboard layout when you use the cheat:us: layout.

=== X-Windows Video Options
{top}

These options affect the graphical X-Windows interface.  If the
console frame-buffer is enabled, the X-Windows default graphics
driver is +fbdev+ which will force X-Windows to have the same
resolution as the consoles.  Since the *antiX* sets the default
console resolution to 800x600, using the default +fbdev+ graphics
driver results in very poor resolution in X-Windows.  Therefore
we write a default +xorg.conf+ file that uses the +vesa+ graphics
driver (which used to be the default) whenever we think the default
+fbdev+ driver is going to be used.  We also create an +xorg.conf+
file with the +sisimedia+ driver when we detect SiS hardware.

We use the +/sbin/make-xorg-conf+ script to make xorg.conf files.
The list from the cheat:xorg=<list>: boot parameter gets passed
to this program.

 * cheat:dpi=NNN:
   DPI stands for "dots per inch".  It controls the size
   of most fonts.  A larger DPI value will give you larger fonts and
   as smaller value will give you smaller fonts.  The default is
   cheat:96:.  This setting is stored in the Display Manager
   configuration file.  On **antiX** this is +/etc/slim.conf+.

 * cheat:xorg=<parameter-list>:
    Force a particular driver to be used, set the screen
   resolution or even set the horizontal and vertical frequency
   ranges.  Accepts a comma separated list of parameters.  Any other
   cheat:xorg=: parameter that is not specified below is treated as
   the name of a video driver to use.  If that driver cannot be found
   on the system then there will be a large error message in red
   explaining the problem.

   - cheat:WWWWxHHHH: any parameter that looks like a resolution,
     a set of digits, an "x" and then another set of digits is treated
     like a resolution and sets the resolution of the X display.  We
     usually add fallback resolutions in case the one you specified
     does not work out.

   - cheat:h=XXXXX: set the range of horizontal frequencies

   - cheat:v=YYYYY: set the range of vertical frequencies

   - cheat:safe: use the "vesa" driver and use a conservative
     set of resolutions

  - cheat:default: use the vesa driver and use a slightly less
    conservative set of resolutions

  - cheat:vbox: set frequencies and resolutions that are optimized for
    *some* uses inside of Virtual Box

 * cheat:noxorg: Don't make an xorg.conf file.


== Mounting
{top}

These options control automatic and semi-automatic mounting of
block devices in the Live system.


 * cheat:automount|amnt: Enable automounting.  All the partitions on a
   usb stick will get mounted automatically when the usb stick is
   plugged in.

 * cheat:automount=all|usb: In addition to enabling automounting as
   above, also mount some or all partitions are boot-time.

   - cheat:automount=all: Mount all partitions at boot-time.

   - cheat:automount=usb: Mount partitions on usb devices at boot-time.

 * cheat:mount=: Mount partitions at boot-time without enabling
   automounting.  The options are just like those for cheat:automount:
   above.

 * cheat:fstab=<list>: This option controls the fstab hotplug feature.
   Normally, fstab entires and +/media+ mountpoints will be created
   for you automatically when you plug in a usb-stick.  These are the
   values than can be used with cheat:fstab=: parameter:

 - cheat:off: Turn off all fstab hotplug and automount features. 
   An +fstab+ file will still be created for you at boot-time and
   mountpoints for partitions will be added under the +/media+
   directory at boot-time but after that, no automatic changes to
   +fstab+ or the +/media+ mountpoints will be made.

 - cheat:nolabel: Don't use disk labels for +/media+ mountpoints. Use
   UUIDs or device names instead.

 - cheat:uuid: Use UUID as the fallback for mountpoint name if a label
   isn't used.  A label won't be used if it doesn't exist or if labels
   were turned off with the cheat:nolabel: directive.

 - cheat:encode: Normally, if special characters are used in a
   partition label, the are converted to underscore in the mountpoint
   name.  Use this directive to use have the special characters
   encoded in hex instead.  This should match the names of the
   symlinks in +/dev/disk/by-label/+.

== Personalization
{top}

These options let you customize or personalize your system.  They
will all be carried over to the hard drive when you install.

 * cheat:desktop=<icon-wm>: This option sets the default window
   manager and desktop icon manager (if any).  For example:
   cheat:desktop=rox-icewm: will set the window manager to be IceWM
   and will use Rox to handle desktop icons.  The only other icon
   manager available is SpaceFM.  So cheat:desktop=space-fluxbox: will
   use Fluxbox as the window manager and use SpaceFM to handle desktop
   icons.  **New for antiX-15::** a cheat:min-: prefix is allowed.
   This turns off the icon manager and all extra goodies (such as
   conky) so you get just the bare-bones window manager.  

 * cheat:hostname=<name>: Set the hostname of the system.  The default
 * hostname is *antiX1*.

 * cheat:lang=<LL>: In **antiX**, this option sets more than just
   the language.  It also sets the keyboard layout, the Debian mirror,
   and the timezone.  If you set any of these others explicitly then
   that setting will over-ride the value set via cheat:lang:.

 * cheat:mirror=MM: Set the country of the Debian mirror.  Usually this
   option is set to a 2-letter country code such as cheat:mirror=gr:.
   **Note** that we now use the +/sbin/localize-repo+ program to
   select the Debian repo and the antiX/MX repo based on the
   time-zone.

 * cheat:tz=<zone>: Set the timezone.  Example: cheat:tz=America/Denver:.
   Some languages, such as en_US (United States English) cover more than
   one timezone so setting the cheat:lang: may not set the correct timezone
   for you. More languages choices have been added to the F2-Language
   menu in the bootloader in order make it easier to set both the
   language and the time-zone with that menu.

== Other Live System Features
{top}

These options control features that are specific to the Live system
but don't fit into any of the previous categories.  Some of these
are available in the bootloader menus.


=== Disable Some SystemV Services
{top}

This option will disable some startup services for faster booting and
less memory consumption.

 * cheat:disable_srv=|antiX=|aX=:

Valid values are a combination of the following letters:

 L = lean        Turn off some services
 X = Xtralean    Turn off even more services
 M = mean        Turn off some networking services
 D = nodbus      Dont' launch dbus

Lean services:

  acpid           acpi-fakekey    acpi-support    bootlogs        bluetooth
  cpufrequtils    cron            cups            gpm             ifplugd
  irqbalance      loadcpufreq     nfs-common      rpcbind         rsync
  rsyslog         saned           smartmontools   ssh             stop-bootlogd
  sudo            wicd

Note that acpid and wicd will not be disabled if we detect laptop
hardware.

Xtralean services:

=== Other Live Options
{top}

 * cheat:checkfs: (**LiveUSB Only**)
   Perform file system check on the cheat:LiveUSB:.
   This won't check the file system of a LiveCD.  Will also check the
   filesystem of the persistence device (if different from the boot device)
   and the file systems on the persistence files +rootfs+ and +homefs+ if
   they exist and are enabled.  It will only check the following types of file
   systems: ext2, ext3, and ext4.

 * cheat:gfxsave=*: (**LiveUSB Only**)
   Set the bootloader current bootloader settings as the defaults.  Valid
   values: cheat:custom:, cheat:menus:, cheat:both:, and cheat:reset:.
   **Note:** the cheat:gfsave: options will usually not work on a frugal
   install.

 * cheat:md5|checkmd5:
   Check the md5sum of the three primary files needed to boot a live system:
   +linuxfs+, +vmlinuz+, and +initrd.gz+.  If this test passes then your
   boot media should be good although this won't necessarily catch
   intermittent problems.

 * cheat:nocheckfs:
   The LiveUSB acts like an installed system and will automatically check its
   own filesystem based the time since the last check and/or the number of
   mounts since the last check.  Use this option to turn this feature off.

 * cheat:toram:
   Copy the entire +linuxfs+ file into RAM.  This takes up RAM.  The amount
   of RAM used will be about the same as the size of the .iso file used to
   create the LiveCD or LiveUSB.  It will also take some time when you first
   boot to copy the file into RAM.  But after this, the system will run very
   fast.  You can also eject the LiveCD (or remove the LiveUSB while the
   system is running.
