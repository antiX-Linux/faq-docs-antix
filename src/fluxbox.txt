== First look
{top}
image:wm/rox-fluxbox.jpg"[]

.Where do I start? I don't see a Start or Menu button.

Just right-click anywhere on the desktop and use the menu to open any application.

.What is this desktop?

The desktop is run by Fluxbox, a lightweight window manager for the X Window 
System that provides the display resources and functions.

.Where are the icons?

Fluxbox does not use icons, but antiX has an application that can manage 
desktop icons for it ie ROX or SpaceFM.

Both ROX and SpaceFM come already preconfigured with some icons in antiX.
Click on F6 boot menu to set icon-desktop manager.
 
If at desktop:
Menu --> Desktop --> Other Desktops --> 

.What's that stuff in the upper right corner?

That is the output of Conky, a light-weight system monitor that gives you 
real-time information on various aspects of your computer.

.And that bar at the bottom?

That is called the toolbar or panel, and it displays current info such as 
the workspace, open applications, background applications and the date/time.

.How do I set up a wireless connection?

There are 4 options, all found in the antiX Control Centre (CC): Wicd (full only), wpa-supplicant, 
GPRS/UMTS and ceni. antiX developers recommend ceni.

== Basic Operation

.Where's the sound volume control?

To change the volume level press the Alt key, point the mouse cursor over 
the desktop and roll the mouse wheel up or down.
Or simply click on the sound icon in the toolbar.

.Where are my files?

As in all Linux versions, personal files are located in antiX by default 
in the /home directory of the Linux file system.

.Is there an easy way to find a specific file?

Click Menu --> Applications -->accessories-->Searchmonkey for files or folders.

.How are files managed?

Click Menu --> Files to open a graphical file manager that is at the heart 
of the ROX desktop (see ROX section). It opens to your home directory, 
where you can change to view to include hidden system files by clicking 
on the eye icon up on the menu bar. Right-click a file to see management 
options.

For a command-line file manager, click Menu --> Terminal - Type mc to bring 
up Midnight Commander, whose main interface consists of two panels 
displaying the file system with numbered commands on the bottom. 
Press F1 for help.

SpaceFM is another excellent file manager included with antiX. 
SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file manager for Linux with built-in VFS, udev-based 
device manager, customizable menu system, and bash integration.
click Menu --> Applications --> System Tools --> SpaceFM

.How do I manipulate an open window?

In addition to the standard operations with the three buttons in the 
upper-right corner, other possibilities (Send To, Layer, etc.) are available 
by right-clicking the titlebar. Double-clicking the title bar will shade 
the window. You can resize it by dragging the lower right corner. You can 
also group several windows in the same title bar by dragging them with the 
middle mouse button.
