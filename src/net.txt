== Connect to the Internet
{top}

antiX should automatically connect you to the Internet 
if you are using a wired (ethernet) connection. 
For wireless, you will have to configure your network connection.
antiX provides 2 tools for this; ceni and wicd. 
antiX devs recommend ceni because it uses a lot less RAM.

== Ceni
{top}

Ceni is the default network manager used on antiX. 
It is a CLI application, which allows users to configure 
/etc/network/interfaces through a command-line interface.
It supports wired and wireless connections.

The screenshots below show the procedure for a WPA wireless set up.

== Wicd

antiX also ships with wicd on antiX-full and antiX-base.
Default boot from live media has wicd DISABLED!
If you prefer it over ceni, then you MUST enable it
at the live boot menu by pressing F4 > wicd.

Wicd is probably the better choice if you use wireless 'on the go' on a laptop
eg from various cafes, hotels etc.


== Dialup

Some may wonder why we still include this option.
It is because so many parts of the world only have dialup.
antiX ships with gnome-ppp as it is light and simple to configure.
