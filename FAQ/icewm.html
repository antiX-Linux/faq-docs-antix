<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What is this?</div><p>The desktop is run by IceWM, a lightweight window manager for the X Window
System whose goal is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user&#8217;s way.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Where are the icons?</div><p>IceWM does not use icons, but antiX uses ROX to add icons.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>ROX comes already preconfigured with some icons in antiX by default. For more information
on ROX-Desktop&#8217;s operation, including icon management, see section on Rox.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In all three above cases it&#8217;s needed to set the respective apps in ~/.icewm/startup
for them to start automatically at session&#8217;s start.
Open CC -&#8594; Configure Icewm -&#8594; startup and uncomment the line rox --pinboard=antiX-ice &amp;
below the line: ## Set desktop icons</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What&#8217;s that stuff in the upper right corner?</div><p>That is the output of Conky, a light-weight system monitor that gives
you real-time information on various aspects of your computer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">And that bar at the bottom?</div><p>That is called the toolbar or panel, and it displays (L -&#8594; R) the start
button, Show Desktop, Workspaces 1-2 (or desktops), and on the far right, Volume and the date/time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>(Note:  If you hover your mouse pointer over the items in the toolbar you
will see the names, and we will refer to the start button as Menu, or Favourite
Applications or start button.)</p></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_basic_configuration">Basic Configuration</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How do I set up a wireless connection?</div><p>There are 4 options, all found in the antiX Control Centre: Wicd (full only), wpa_supplicant,
GRPS/UMTS and ceni. antiX developers recommend ceni.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
In  Control Centre -&#8594; Network -&#8594; you will find the wireless frontend
Wicd that antiX uses to make its wireless connection.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The command-line (CLI) tool Ceni from the aptosid developers is a wrapper
that is very efficient for setting up a connection: Choose under Hardware
interfaces either your wired or wireless connection, click on your choice
and you can then configure that choice, it is an intuitive application.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
For those with GRPS/UMTS use the application in the antiX CC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Configure Dial-Up Connection using Gnome PPP in the antiXCC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
wpa_gui is also included in the antiX Control Centre.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What about dial-up?</div><p>Control Centre -&#8594; Network-&#8594;Configure Dial-Up Connection. This brings up
Gnome PPP, a graphical frontend for the excellent WvDial tool. Intuitive
interface makes it easy to use.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How do I set up printing?</div><p>Unless you have an HP printer (see next entry), do one of the following:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
In antiX CC -&#8594; Hardware -&#8594; Setup a Printer.  A screen will open showing
you the printers that have been found, with an icon to click for an assistant
to add a new printer.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Open up a browser (Menu -&#8594; Browser), and enter: <a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/</a>
This will take you to the CUPS interface, where you can set up your
printer. For help on particular printers and drivers, check the OpenPrinting
database.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How do I set up an HP printer?</div><p>The easiest method is to use the Package-Installer, located
in the antiX CC -&#8594;System-&#8594; Package-installer, then click on the
arrow for Office and tick the check box for HP_printing, then Install.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you prefer to do it yourself, then do the following, (Warning! This may
be incomplete due to subsequent changes in packages —use at your own risk!)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You may need to install some additional packages:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>hpijs
hpijs-ppd
hplip-data
hplip
hplip-gui
cups-pdf
cupsys-client
cupsys-driver-gutenprint
gs-gpl
lpr
magicfilter
gv
xprint-utils</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You should then be able to set up your printer by opening up a browser
(Menu -&#8594; Browser), and entering: <a href="http://localhost:631/">http://localhost:631/</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What about a scanner?</div><p>This one should be easy. Connect your scanner to the computer, and click
Menu -&#8594; Applications -&#8594; Graphics -&#8594; Simple Scan (xsane) or you can dl via synaptic
Xscanimage where, after installing and updating the menu, launch Xscanimage,
then selecting from the scanners it has found (it may have multiple entries
for your one scanner, so try them all until one works), you will see a
very basic screen which is pretty self-evident. To adjust the values of
your scanner, click Menu -&#8594; Run and type xcam.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can then edit the scan in Mirage (Menu -&#8594; Applications -&#8594; Graphics).
For details on using Mirage, check its User Manual.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What application should I use for system setup?</div><p>antiX comes with two applications to make system configuration or managing
users easier. They can be found in the antiX CC -&#8594; System-&#8594; Configure System
or Manage Users.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">I want to configure my monitor&#8212;how do I do that?</div><p>The easiest method is to use the Set Screen Resolution in antiX CC -&#8594; Session-&#8594; Set Screen Resolution.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This will launch the application grandr.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Are there any other antiX Assistants I should know about?</div><p>The antiX user-management script unites a number of tools having to do with
user management. Found in antiX CC -&#8594; System</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Can I use a MP3 player such as an iPod with antiX?</div><p>You can play MP3 files with xmms, and you can view and edit ID3 tags by
installing the program EasyTAG. But there is no simple way to synchronize
your player with your host computer without installing Amarok and the KDE
files it depends on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Is there a way to interact with a digital camera?</div><p>The easiest method is to just treat it as a storage device by using a USB
card reader. Then when you connect it to the computer, it will be mounted
and available as an entry in the directory /media. You can either click
Menu -&#8594; Files to examine and move or delete the contents, or click
Menu -&#8594; Applications -&#8594; Graphics and choose to bring up Gtkam or Mirage
to manipulate your images with the program of your choice.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How do I install nvidia/ATI driver for antiX?</div><p>The best way to do this is via the included app available in the control centre.
Alternatively, use the smxi script.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Can I use a webcam?</div><p>Many web cams will work with antiX.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p><div class="top-link">[<a class="top-link" href="#banner-text">top</a>]</div></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Where are my files?</div><p>As in all Linux versions, personal files are located in antiX by default
in the /home directory of the Linux file system.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How are files managed?</div><p>antiX has two graphical file managers, one of them is Rox-Filer which can be
opened clicking on the Home Folder icon in IceWM&#8217;s taskbar or from Menu -&#8594; Home.
Rox-Filer is a graphical file manager that is at the heart of the ROX desktop
(see ROX FAQ section). It opens to your home directory, where you can change
the view to include hidden system files by clicking on the eye icon up on
the menu bar. Right-click a file to see management options. Among them is
Options&#8230;, which manages ROX&#8217;s settings.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The other one is SpaceFM, found under Menu -&#8594;Applications -&#8594; System Tools -&#8594; SpaceFM.
SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file manager for Linux with built-in VFS, udev-based
device manager, customizable menu system, and bash integration.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For a command-line file manager, click Menu -&#8594; Terminal -&#8594; and type mc,
which brings up Midnight Commander, whose main interface consists of
two panels displaying the file system with numbered commands on the bottom.
Press F1 for help.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Can I synchronize files/folders?</div><p>Go to antiX CC -&#8594; Disks -&#8594; Synchronize Directories or to
Menu -&#8594; Applications -&#8594; System tools -&#8594; Grsync.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What if I need to edit a text file?</div><p>You have five good options in antiX, from the lightest, to the simplest,
up to a full-featured one. Two are available by clicking Menu -&#8594; Tools -&#8594;  Editors.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Nano is a command-line application run by control keys listed at the
bottom of the screen. Press Ctrl-G to access the help file.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To get to Leafpad simply click Menu -&#8594; Editor .
It&#8217;s a simple graphical application that includes essential features and
uses familiar pull-down menus.
</p>
</li>

fast editor with basic features of an integrated development environment
like syntax highlighting etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
LibreOffice  (Menu -&#8594;Applications -&#8594; Office -&#8594; LibreOffice Writer)
LibreOffice is a power-packed free, libre and open source personal productivity
suite for Windows, Macintosh and GNU/Linux. antiX comes with five of its feature-rich
applications for all your document production and data processing needs: Writer, Calc,
Impress, Draw and Math.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can open any text for editing in the file managers Rox-filer, SpaceFM and MC.</p></div>

up File-Roller, migrate to the file location, highlight the file and click
Extract on the icon bar.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How do I install and manage software?</div><p>There are a number of methods of managing software in antiX, the most common
of which are the command-line application Apt and the graphical user interface
for it known as Synaptic.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
To get to Apt just click Menu -&#8594; Terminal and become root (type su
followed by root&#8217;s password).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
To get to Synaptic, which is sometimes easier for a newbie, open a root
terminal as just described, then just type in the word synaptic. It is
also found in the antiX CC -&#8594; System, called Manage Packages.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How do I keep the system up-to-date?</div><p>Before either updating the system or installing software for the first time,
it&#8217;s necessary to update the package database. Do this by opening Synaptic
(see above) and clicking on the Reload button or opening a root terminal
(Menu -&#8594; Applications -&#8594; Accessories -&#8594; Root Terminal) and type:
apt-get update</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Do not use Synaptic for a system upgrade! To upgrade software you will have
to use the terminal, either with Apt, Aptitude (needs installing) or smxi.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>antiX is based on the Debian Stable repositories. So to update the system (in a
root terminal) type: apt-get update (followed by) apt-get dist-upgrade</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you receive any kind of error messages during the update, check antiX
forums at <a href="https://www.antixforum.com">https://www.antixforum.com</a> to see
if someone already posted a solution for it. If not, please don&#8217;t be shy
and ask for help.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For an off-line overview of Apt usage and resources open the terminal and
type man apt. Feel free to explore its subsections: man apt-get, man apt-cache,
man sources.list etc.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><div class="title">After installing new programs do they appear in the menu?</div><ul>
<li>
<p>
Yes. This is a new feature included originally in antiX-15. Menus are automatically updated.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">How can I get my email?</div><p>Clicking Menu -&#8594;Applications-&#8594; Internet -&#8594;Claws Mail  You enter
setup by following the wizard that pops up the first time you use the
application and filling in the blanks with the information for your email account(s).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">What does antiX offer for web browsing?</div><p>The default browser is the full-featured Firefox-esr.
Click Menu -&#8594;Web Browser or the taskbar icon to launch it.
It&#8217;s compatible with many Firefox extensions.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Three other lightweight browsers are also included under Menu -&#8594; Applications -&#8594; Internet.
Dillo is a fast, minimalistic multi-platform web browser that is highly secure,
while the links2 browser is a graphics and text mode web browser that is
also very fast and safe and has pull-down menus available by clicking on
the top bar.
Finally elinks is a text mode browser.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are many other browsers available for download.
Just have a look in the package-installer.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you have low RAM (1GB and less), antiX users recommend
one of the following for a lighter and faster experience than
that offerred by the default browser Firefox-esr.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
